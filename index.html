      <form class="well" id="question2">
        <p>What kind of company do you  want to work for, <span class="echoName"></span>?</p>
        <p>At a start up you may exchange financial compensation for stock options which may or may not someday be worth something. The culture is very relaxed. They may have beer taps right in the office and even tolerate the reek of pot smoke when you clock in at 10am. Provided you stick around until 10pm.</p>
        <p>A midsize company can still be pretty fun to work for but slackers get weeded out pretty carefully. They provide fairly generous financial compensation and if they're not too close to IPO you might get decent stock options or an employee stock purchase plan. But the IPO is not going to make you a millionaire.</p>
        <p>An old company is not very fun to work at. They'll act shocked if you have one beer at lunch but at least you can get pretty hammered at the Holiday Party. Compensation will be pretty stingy unless you're badly needed, but pension and benefits are usually fantastic.</p>
